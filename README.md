## Extras

I started charging my phone with it resting horizontally and its screen facing me. It's an old cheap Samsung phone - no AMOLED here, so no true blacks. I often leave it with the screen off, but as I don't use my phone as much, it's just resting there with no function. Therefore an idea sparked to create a Standby Mode inspired website!
